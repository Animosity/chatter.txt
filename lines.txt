i can see 4x faster than most plat comp players at least .
with this monitor gsynced
its 240hz performance, you do the math
I will be shot caller since i can see the action faster than a lot of you
I will do the shot caller position , unless someone else has G sync at 240 hertz ?
i am seeing their tactics sooner by approx 400%
definitely seeing their ults faster now
check youre ALienware driver app after this match for the new update
new usb 3.1 mouse support  and its properly nVidia gsynced at 240 hz finally
i'm thinking we should have more aggro
am i alone in saying we need to mix this up!
im not recommending anyone with bad attitudes
dont ask me to recommend you unless you deserve it
